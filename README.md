This project analyzes factors affecting car prices in the US market to help a Chinese automobile company enter the market successfully. We implement and evaluate multiple regression models to predict car prices and identify the most significant features influencing pricing.

Key Findings
Best Performing Model: Random Forest Regressor typically performs best with the highest R-squared value and lowest error metrics.

Important Features: Engine size, horsepower, curb weight, and car dimensions are usually among the most significant factors.

Model Improvement: Hyperparameter tuning didn't help enhance the model's performance.

Results Interpretation
R-squared: Measures how well the model explains the variability of the target variable (price). Higher is better (max 1).

MSE (Mean Squared Error): Average squared difference between predicted and actual prices. Lower is better.

MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Average absolute difference between predicted and actual prices. Lower is better.
